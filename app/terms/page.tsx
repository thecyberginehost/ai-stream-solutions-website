          <p>
            Welcome to AI Stream Solutions. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our website, products,

          <h2>2. Subscription and Payment Terms</h2>
          <h3>2.1 Subscription Options</h3>
          <p>
            AI Stream Solutions offers various subscription plans with different features and pricing. Subscriptions may
            be offered on a monthly, annual, or biannual basis, with discounts typically applied to longer-term
            commitments.
          </p>

          <h3>2.2 Custom Contracts</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to our standard subscription plans, we offer custom contracts tailored to specific business
            needs. These custom contracts may include specialized features, custom integrations, or other services not
            included in standard subscription plans.
          </p>

          <h3>2.3 Payment Terms</h3>
          <p>
            Monthly subscriptions are billed at the beginning of each month. Annual and biannual subscriptions are
            billed in full at the beginning of the subscription period. Custom payment schedules may be arranged for
            custom contracts.
          </p>

          <h3>2.4 Extended Prepayment Options</h3>
          <p>
            Clients may choose to prepay for services for periods longer than our standard offerings (e.g., 3 years, 5
            years). Such arrangements will be documented in a custom contract with specific terms, including any
            applicable discounts for extended prepayment.
          </p>

          <h3>2.5 Automatic Renewal</h3>
          <p>
            Unless otherwise specified, subscriptions automatically renew at the end of the subscription period. You may
            cancel automatic renewal at any time through your account settings or by contacting us at
            info@aistreamsolutions.com.
          </p>

          <h3>2.6 Price Changes</h3>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to modify our pricing at any time. For existing subscribers, price changes will take
            effect at the beginning of the next billing cycle. We will provide at least 30 days' notice of any price
            changes.
